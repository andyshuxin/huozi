Bisheng
=======
Bisheng is a GUI wrapper around AEP (see below) that facilitates production of an online magazine. Bisheng grew out of the experiences of me editing and supervising production of 1510 Weekly.
For the moment, Bisheng is customized for 1510 Weekly production, hence Chinese-oriented.
The package is under development and far from decent usability.

## AEP
Automated E-Digest Processor is a package that provides tools for editors of electronic digest-type magazine.
It includes these tools:
+ A text cleaner that removes redundant spaces, blank lines, and unify punctuation marks.
+ A html parser that extract its main text and guess title, author, and where the sub-headlines lies.
+ A grabber that grabs a URL, Unicode supported.

## System Requirment
+ lxml, BeautifulSoup 4
+ chardet
+ MS Word (for doc output)
