Bisheng
=======
Bisheng is a GUI wrapper around AEP (see below) that facilitates production of an online magazine. Bisheng grew out of the experiences of me editing and supervising production of 1510 Weekly.
For the moment, Bisheng is customized for 1510 Weeklly production.

## AEP

+ A text cleaner that removes redundant spaces, blank lines, and unify puntuation marks.
+ A html parser that extract its main text and guess title, author, and where the subheadlines lies.
+ A grabber that grabs a URL, Unicode supported.
