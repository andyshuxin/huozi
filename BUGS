1. On Windows XP, Highlighting malfunctions for the first or last line, at times.

2. If a subheadline repeats itself in the text, only the first will be highlighted
      in the GUI, but all instances will be bolded in doc file created. This is
      due to the text-based storage system. Until it is converted to line number-
      #based, it is unlikely to be solved. Fortunately, it's rare that two
      identical lines exists, and only one is subheadline.

3. If a category has no articles under it, it will be ignored in final output.
