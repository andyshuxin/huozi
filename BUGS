1. If a subheadline repeats itself in the text, only the first will be
      highlighted in the GUI, but all instances will be bolded in doc file
      created. This is due to the text-based storage system. Until it is
      converted to line number-based, it is unlikely to be solved. Fortunately,
      it's rare that two identical lines exists, and only one is subheadline.

   buttons are activated.

6. createDoc empties the clipboard.

7. Teaser should be 12pt.

8. Under Windows, in OpenIssueFrame, if I manually input a path, say "e:", it breaks.

9. If createDoc quits prematurely, WINWORD.exe is still there, not visible,
   blocking attempts to save under the same filename as it opens.

10. Pops 'lost unsaved progress' warning even when there is none.

11. After I click infobar to config issue, article info are gone.

12. TOC creation fails with 'out of range' from time to time.

13. subtitle setting needs further work. use subtitle, which is set independet from Normal,
    heading level 0, instead of heading 3

14. If ConfigIssueFrame() is closed by the close button, MainFrame remains disabled.
