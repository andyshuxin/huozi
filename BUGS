1. If a subheadline repeats itself in the text, only the first will be
      highlighted in the GUI, but all instances will be bolded in doc file
      created. This is due to the text-based storage system. Until it is
      converted to line number-based, it is unlikely to be solved. Fortunately,
      it's rare that two identical lines exists, and only one is subheadline.

2. Highlighting the first and last line as subhead is temporarily disabled.

3. If a category has no articles under it, it will be ignored in final output.

4. Can't extract author from: http://my1510.cn/article.php?id=95064

5. (Windows only) After one article is added, you can click the empty space in listbox, still the modify and delete
   buttons are activated.

6. createDoc empties the clipboard.

7. Teaser should be 12pt.

8. Under Windows, in OpenIssueFrame, if I manually input a path, say "e:", it breaks.

9. If createDoc quits prematurely, WINWORD.exe is still there, not visible,
   blocking attempts to save under the same filename as it opens.
