1. On Win XP, Highlighting malfunctions for the first or last line, at times.

2. If a subheadline repeats itself in the text, only the first will be
      highlighted in the GUI, but all instances will be bolded in doc file
      created. This is due to the text-based storage system. Until it is
      converted to line number-based, it is unlikely to be solved. Fortunately,
      it's rare that two identical lines exists, and only one is subheadline.

3. If a category has no articles under it, it will be ignored in final output.

4. If you input a ratio in SetArticleFrame, but not auto-retrieve it, the
   ratio will be recorded, even though it's not used.

5. Can't extract author from: http://my1510.cn/article.php?id=95064
